Description = Weasels! is a mod for all those craving to see those little furry creatures in Baldur's Gate EE, Baldur's Gate 2 EE and Icewind Dale EE

The Infinity Engine games always needed more weasels, right? That's why I decided to create this mod. It introduces 5 weasel-themed items to BG:EE / BG2:EE / IWD:EE and also adds 6 new spells (1 arcane spell for mages / wizards / bards, 2 bard-exclusive spells, 1 spell shared by both arcane and divine casters, and 2 divine spells for druids / shamans / rangers) which are available through both character creation and scrolls you may find during your adventures (bard-exclusive spells, though, are available only through scrolls).
